# A Deep Learning Approach to Particle Reconstruction
# MLTracking
MLTracking is a machine learning package for the Mu2e experiment, of which main part  The package is developed by Billy Li and advised by Professor Ken
Heller, Dr. Dan Ambrose, and Kate Ciampa at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities.

## Mu2e @ Minnesota

The muon-to-electron-conversion (Mu2e) experiment is going to search for the
neutrino-less muon-to-electron conversion. Such a conversion that violates
the charged-lepton flavor conservation is beyond the standard model, but is
predicted by more advanced theories such as supersymmetry, Higgs doublets, and other
models explaining the neutrino mass hierarchy.

The Mu2e group at the University of Minnesota is working on Mu2e tracker's
assembly, quality assurance, and improvements. Besides, we are also discovering
 novel methods to conduct particle reconstruction.

This website is particularly for the documentation of deep learning approaches
to particle reconstruction
